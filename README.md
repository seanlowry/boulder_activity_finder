Users will first be directed to a login screen where they will have the option to create an account or login.  Their usernames and passwords will be stored in a PostgresSQL database.

From there, the user will be directed to the siteâ€™s home page where they will be able to browse the event and activity postings that are available from other users based on their own preferences and filters.  They will also have the ability to navigate to pages that control their user settings and their own personal postings.  These postings will also be stored in separate SQL databases.  Users will be able to post comments and pictures under the events posting as well.

The front-end of the application will be designed using HTML and CSS, JavaScript, and EJS and the site will be hosted using NodeJS and the Heroku platform.
